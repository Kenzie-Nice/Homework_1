      <h2>Welcome to My GitHub Page</h2>
      <p>My name is Kenzie. I enjoy gaming, reading, and obsessing over my bunny. I am a Senior going for a major in Game Design/Media Arts, expected to graduate in Spring 2025. By some unknown miracle, I am in honors... don't know how that happened, but it did.</p>

      <h2>A Memorable Gaming Moment</h2>
      <p>A memorable gaming moment for me... well, there are many. But one in particular: late at night, I sat in the living room in the dark, my father asleep on the couch as I played the ending of FFXV. I remember crying so hard at the end of the game (it's incredibly sad). I donâ€™t think it's a bad memory, but just how impactful the story and the game were to me when I was younger.</p>

      <h2>Looking at the World</h2>
      <p>Looking at the world itself, I feel like I am rather blind. There are many things to see about it, but often we are too absorbed in our tiny version of it and we lack the ability to see what is really out there. More so, in what way does one truly see the world? From the perspective of oneself? Of our own small world? The world in a general policy, such as society as a whole? Or rather from a complex standpoint of how one feels directly about the world and our place within it? There is too much to say and too little to really go from.</p>
