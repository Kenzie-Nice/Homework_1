      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A memorable gaming moment for me is when I played FFXV's ending late at night. It was so emotional, and I cried. The impact of the game stays with me.</p>

      <h2>Learning and Growth</h2>
      <p>As I continue my journey, I'm always discovering new perspectives. Sometimes it's difficult to see beyond our own experiences, but that's the beauty of exploring new ideas.</p>
